Introduction

   The [7]WeBWorKTeam is pleased to announce the release of version 2.1
   of the WeBWorK Program Generating Language (PG). This release includes
   new features and bug fixes:

     * New [8]mathematical-expression parser (for use in writing PG
       problems).
     * Fixed generation of LaTeX version of sqrt.
     * Fixed implementation of useBaseTenLog flag.
     * Make combinations function C(n,k) return 0 when k>n, which is
       standard.
     * Fixed error when using cplx_cmp.

   (Contributiors: please feel free to add anything I've forgotten.)

Availability

   PG is distributed as a tarball. It is available on our SourceForge
   project page:
   [9]http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=93112

   To use this library, you will probably want to download WeBWorK. See
   [10]AvailableVersions for more information.

   Installation directly from CVS is also possible. Refer to the
   [11]InstallationManualV2pt1 for more information.

Installation

   Documentation on installing and configuring PG is available in the
   WeBWorK [12]InstallationManualV2pt1. If you are upgrading an existing
   installation, be sure to read the section [13]Upgrading an existing
   WeBWorK installation.

Help

   If you need help installing or using PG 2.1, consult [14]WeBWorKDocs
   and [15]WeBWorKFAQs.

   You can also visit the [16]WeBWorK discussion group and post your
   question there. The developers monitor this forum.

Bug Reports & Feature Requests

   Submit bug reports and feature requests at
   [17]http://bugs.webwork.rochester.edu/. We can't fix bugs and add
   features if you don't tell us about them!

Patches

   While we welcome patches of any sort, by patching against the latest
   CVS code, you save us and yourself time. A bug in this release may be
   fixed in CVS, and we can more easily handle patches against the latest
   code. Check out the latest development version from CVS and patch
   against that. Consult the [18]WeBWorKCVS topic for more information.
