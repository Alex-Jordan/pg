# Put Selenium tests here.  The easiest way to generate these tests is to
# use the Selenium IDE for Firefox with the additional plugin which
# allows you to export scripts from Selenium IDE to Perl.  The basic method is
#
# 1. Use the Selenium IDE to record your actions performing some test.
# 2. Export the test as Perl and copy the results here.
#
# Working with Selenium and making tests takes some practice.  Here are some
# links that were good at the time of writing
#
# Selenium IDE: http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/ide/
# Selenium IDE Plugin: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/selenium-ide/
# Selenium IDE Perl Plugin: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/selenium-ide-perl-formatter/
