# This runs all of the test files passed via the command line.  If nothing is

# All tests in this test suite should be run on a fresh webwork install
# with no courses (besides the admin course) and an admin course user with
# user name admin and password admin.  (Basically the setup you get from

    This command is used to run Selenium based testing scripts for WeBWorK.  
In order to use it you will need to have a Selenium Standalone Server running. 
The jar file for this server can be downloaded from www.seleniumhq.org.  You 
will also need a copy of Firefox and can optionally set up Xvfb to run the 
tests "headlessly".  This command takes the following options:
    --uname=<admin username> :  This is the username for the admin user that 
will be used to run the tests.
    --pwd=<admin pwd> : This is the password for the admin user that will be 
used to run the tests.
    --all-tests : This runs all of the tests in the Tests directory.  
Alternatively individual tests files can be provided on the command line.
    --help : Print this message.

Example:

run_tests.pl --uname=admin -pwd=12345 Tests/BasicTests/*    

Note:  You can also perminantly set the username and password used for
Selenium tests by setting the WW_TEST_UNAME and WW_TEST_PWD environment
variables.
